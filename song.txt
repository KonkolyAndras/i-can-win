Standing here, I realize
you were just like me trying to make history
But who's to judge the right from wrong?
When our guard is down, I think we'll both agree
That violence breeds violence
But in the end it has to be this way

I've carved my own path
You followed your wrath
But maybe we're both the same
The world has turned, and so many have burned

But nobody is to blame
Yet, staring across this barren, wasted land
I feel new life will be born beneath the blood-stained sand
Beneath the blood-stained sand
